        <h2>Ash Ketchum & Pikachu</h2>
        <p>Ash Ketchum is 10 years old and ready to start his journey in the world of Pokémon and dreams of becoming a
            Pokémon master, but on the day he is to receive his first Pokémon, Ash oversleeps and wakes up in a panic,
            running into Gary Oak, who becomes Ash's rival. Professor Oak, the local Pokémon researcher, has already
            given
            away the three Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle) he entrusts to new Pokémon Trainers when Ash
            finally reaches Oak's Lab. The only Pokémon that he has left is a Pikachu, which he gives to Ash. Determined
            to
            make it on his journey, Ash does his best to befriend Pikachu, but it refuses to trust him and chooses to
            stay
            out of the Poké Ball, even attacking Ash with its electric powers. It is only after Ash protects Pikachu
            from an
            angry group of Spearows that Pikachu realizes how much Ash cares. After this Pikachu and Ash become best
            Friends.</p>

        <h2>Gary Oak</h2>
        <p>Gary Oak is Professor Oak's grandson and Ash Ketchum's rival in the first few seasons. The day Gary started
            out
            on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter Pokémon was
            Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and he even had a
            group
            of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, . His style of training at that point was to
            capture
            many Pokémon and to use the strongest, as a stark contrast to Ash, who was more focused on developing a bond
            with his Pokémon. during the Johto saga, Gary seemed to have become the complete opposite of who he was. He
            became much more polite and respectful to others, including Ash.

            However, he still considered Ash his rival and would continue to do so until after their better at the
            Silver
            Conference.

            Gary used his Blastoise against Ash's Charizard in a hope to win by type matchups, but was defeated by Ash's
            Charizard. After this he decided that he wanted to become a Pokémon researcher, like his grandfather.

            Gary became an even better person during the Hoenn and Sinnoh travels because he gives Ash great advice, and
            helps him out when he needs his help. Sometimes Gary still teases Ash, but to a lesser extent.
